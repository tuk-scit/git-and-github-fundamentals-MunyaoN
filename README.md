This Project is part of a bigger project I am working on of Developing an ultimate program for SACCO's to enable them to run their daily activities. 

The Language used in this project is AL from Microsoft and at some point will need to be bridged with other languages at the point of integration with other system softwares and applications like Mobile banking and SMS

Some folders of this project are not here but can be found since they are default microsoft projects.

You will need to have Business Central Version 20 or later installed, SQL 2019 and SSMS (Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio) installed.

Database used in the development and establishment of this project will not be share because of the confidential data it might contain.
